# Storslysia Social insurance program and relocation scheme!

---

## Executive Summary
This report will be providing information on our designed social natural hazards insurance program for Storslysia against the economic losses and social impacts of the increasing number of extreme catastrophes in the country of Storslysia due to climate change. The diverse geography of Storslysia is considered in terms of the different levels of the financial impact caused by each type of disaster and how insurance products can be introduced for different geographical areas. The report also explores the feasibility of voluntary relocation programs aimed to mitigate the damage natural disasters ahead of time.

According to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the globe is experiencing ascending frequency of extreme natural disasters. Comprehensive data analysis of the risk of catastrophe-related displacement will be provided, along with predictions on all these changes. And more importantly, our social insurance plan and relocation plan will be developed correspondingly to achieve the ultimate goal of reducing the socio-economic impact of climate change on Storslysia over the next 130 years (2020-2150).

Given the limitations and uncertainties of the data, we have made some reasonable assumptions based on some internal data and additional research, and the rationale and analysis are presented in the Appendix. Due to the complexity and variability of climate change, we have combined the IPCC assumptions on socio-economic development, energy use and other factors on climate change impacts and predicted the frequency of hazardous events under different SSP scenarios using the provided frequency prediction model. 


## 1. Objectives of Analysis

### 1.1	 Background
Storslysia has suffered through various major disasters in the past decades, and, with the fast-approaching effects of climate change, the rate and severity of these disasters appear to be ramping up. The number of cases of natural disasters reported in the past decade makes up almost a third of the total reports in the last 60 years. With the looming threat of climate change, it has become imperative to put in place proper social insurance programs that target mitigating and reducing the cost of oncoming natural disasters.

</p>

Yet, amongst the natural hazards that occur in Storslysia, most of the events had a negligible amount of property damage, injuries, and fatalities. Henceforward, the low-risk hazards would be retained. Whilst our insurance program would be primarily designed to transfer the moderate to high-risk hazards along with relocation schemes to reduce the overall risk exposure of Storslysia to natural hazards as below.

### 1.2 Reserving for future disasters

A framework that predicts the consequential costs of natural hazards will be built along with thoughtful financial analysis to advise on building adequate reserves with elevated degrees of certainty to ensure our insurance program’s feasibility and sustainability against extreme disasters.

### 1.3 Voluntary relocation program

As introduced above, our insurance program will be constructed with a relocation program that includes voluntary and post-disaster involuntary relocation. Based on our research, we would focus on relocation schemes that help reduce our exposure to flood-related disasters by a significant margin with a high degree of certainty. On the other hand, we would provide recommendations on infrastructure and private housing development to reduce the subsequent cost of other high-risk disasters.

## 2. Program Design

As introduced in sections 1.2 and 1.3, the two main programs will be:
1.	A comprehensive social insurance program that covers many of the major causes of property damage in Storslysia.
2.	A voluntary relocation program aimed at reducing costs arising from flooding-related events.

### 2.1 Social Insurance Program

Our suggestion is to have an overarching social insurance that covers natural disaster damages to property and possessions and temporary or permanent relocation that arises from the disaster. This program is aimed to cover the damages caused by hurricanes, tropical storms, tornados, hurricanes, flooding, winter weather and flooding-related damages. Importantly, we chose for the program to exclude disasters including wildfires, drought, landslides and fog due to differences in nature and  the rarity of such events leading to the lack of data to properly predict cost and frequency.
We suggest that the program be mandatory for the citizens of Storslysia. Research into natural disaster insurance policies has shown that voluntary programs run the risk of “charity hazard” and have lower participation rates than expected [1]. The premiums collected over the years will be placed into a government reserve. This reserve will build up over time and will be capable of paying for costs related to natural disasters when it occurs.
This insurance program will be triggered when a disaster with damage magnitude over Ꝕ15,000 has occurred. It will cover all property and possession losses caused by the disaster and the temporary relocation costs for residents affected. Upon severe disaster and infeasibility of repairment of the property, the program will provide  involuntary relocation based on the original poverty value. 

### 2.2 Voluntary Relocation Program

Alongside the social insurance program, we want to specifically aim to lower costs arising from flooding and flooding-related damages. Historically, these account for up to 30% of all total major natural disaster events. We believe that a sizeable proportion of these can be mitigated through the planned retreat from households in high-risk areas. Research from other countries has shown that properties that are in 1-in-100-year flood risk zones (expecting 1 flood every 100 years) make up 3-7% of the population. In Storslysia, this translates to over 200,000 housing units that will have to be relocated. This is clearly not feasible, and we will have to make further assumptions on the proportion of houses that are even higher risk, those who are potentially in 1-in-10-year flood risk zones.
In our models, we will discuss the feasibility of mitigating flood damage by offering fully subsidised voluntary relocation for households in these 1-in-10-year flood risk zone areas. However, due to the lack of geographical data, many assumptions will have to be made about Storslysia’s population. In section 3 where we will discuss our relocation models, we will give a more detailed rundown on the optimistic and pessimistic assumptions we have on the population in high-risk areas, the amount of risk mitigation and the participation rate of the program.
We plan to have the program slowly adopted over the next 10 years, aiming to move 10% of the maximum participation rate until reaching the maximum participation.

## 3. Pricing and Costs

### 3.1 Methodologies

</p>

### 3.2 Assumptions

The domestic economy of Storslysia has sustained a healthy level of inflation in most of the years from 1960 to 2020. Without further information on the economy, we were unable to determine the change in the relative price of property damage against income. We assume the real value of consequential poverty damages will vary at the same rate as income and GDP. Hence, past poverty damage will be analysed in form of present value from 1960 to 2020 with the provided inflation statistics and future inflation would be omitted in our analysis. 

For the purpose of modelling, a number of assumptions are required due to the lack of data:
•	Major disasters are assumed to increase the price of material and labour costs by the maximum possible amount under Storslysia law, 50%
•	Major disasters will also assume the pessimistic assumptions of household goods loss of 75% of the property damage
•	A major disaster will cause affected households to be temporarily displaced by up to 12 months after the disaster and require temporary housing. The number of households affected will be estimated by dividing the cost of the disaster by the median house price.
•	There will always be enough temporary housing. 
•	Medium disasters are assumed to increase the price of material and labour costs moderately, increasing costs by 25% after the disaster
•	Medium disasters will cause little to no damage to household goods
•	Medium disasters will not cause temporary displacement
•	Disasters caused by co-occurring disasters are count as one occurrence of each.

</p>

For relocation, we will make the following assumptions:
A..Maximum Participation Rate: It is not expected that all population in the flood risk areas are willing to relocate. Research has shown that the young and middle-aged working class are most willing to relocate [2]. The most successful voluntary relocation program was the New Zealand Christchurch Residential Red Zone relocation program which started in 2011 and had almost reached full participation by 2015 [3]. The relocation of Tacloban, Philippines had 70% participation in 6 years [4]. Research in Mission Beach, Australia has shown that up to 51% of residents are open to the idea of planned retreat prior to a disaster [1].

B. % of Property in 1-in-10-year Flood Risk Zones: Under our model, we note that on average, the damage caused by major flood disasters annually is around 200 times the median price of properties in Storslysia. The assumption in the above table reflects the need to move about 2,000, 4,000 and 6,000 1-in-10-year flood-risk properties. 

C. % of Flood damage caused by 1-in-10-year Flood Risk Zone Properties: As per the definition of 1-in-10-year Flood Risk Zones, these are the properties that will be damaged by floods with lower severity than those of 1-in-100-year Flood Risk Zones. These are expected to cause majority of the major claims.
The relocation program will be funded separately from the social insurance program and will not drain reserves from the social insurance fund.

### 3.3 Model Results

First, we used Monte Carlos simulation on the created Compound Poisson Model to simulate the base case of the future costs arising from natural disasters. This was run under the 4 provided SSP scenarios, with SSP5 being the more extreme scenario in terms of Atmospheric CO¬¬¬¬¬¬¬2.

Running ruin simulation on the base case with premiums the expected cost each year shows the following results:

</p>

Next, we simulate the effect under the inclusion of the relocation program under SSP5. Note that all SSP assumptions will arrive at similar results. (See Appendix E)

The relocation program will result in heavier costs in the first decade, as the full subsidy program relocates citizens away from 1-in-10-year flood risk zones. For the years after the first ten years, the expected cost every year from disaster claims is expected to be lower than without the program. The cost saved over after the 10 years is expected to eventually outweigh the cost of the relocation program. The time required to break even depends on how optimistic the assumptions are from Table 2. Assumption A, the participation rate, will not affect the years needed to breakeven but will affect ruin probabilities. Assumptions B and C have impacts on the cost of the program and how much cost will be saved by the program. Some selected examples of payback years are noted below.

<p align="center"> 
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113341306/229004445-2a0535bd-bcf9-4a80-b5a1-c370f465c23a.png">
</p>

The assumption B, percentage of property in 1-in-10-year flood risk zones, directly impact the cost to relocate the residents away from the hazard zone. If the pessimistic assumption of B is true, then this leads to much heavier costs in the first 10 years of the program.
Assumption C, the percentage of flood damage caused by 1-in-10-year flood risk zone properties, affects how much claim costs are saved in the future years from reduced flooding-related disasters.
Under the optimistic assumptions, the program will be able to break even just 5 years after the relocation program is complete. Post relocation program, Storslysia is expected to save one-sixth of the annual cost spent due to natural disasters. Assumption B increases the payback time the most, as full buyback of properties can turn out to be a very costly endeavour as the number of properties increases. However, we do believe that even under moderate assumptions, the relocation program is worth considering. Albeit unlikely, if both pessimistic assumptions on B and C are true, then the program can take a very long time to be able to see any benefits.

![Table 7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113341306/229004488-6a062c45-535d-4693-b96a-ad0d256f64ed.png)

In our model, assumption A directly influence the amount of reduction to the number of occurrences of natural disasters. In reducing the number of occurrences, we are directly targeting the value at risk for each year. This allows the social insurance program to have a lower probability of ruin under the same starting reserve.
Assumptions B and C will not affect the ruin probability as we will be financing the 2 programs separately.

On the relocation program, the following table contains expected annual costs for the next decade under different assumptions:

### 3.4 Premiums

The premiums are set to be expected cost of next year’s disasters. We aim to charge different areas differently based on their risk exposure. Due to the lack of geographical data, we are only able to price for each region.

## 5. Risk and Risk Mitigation Considerations

The above analysis of our project is built based on a no change in relative pricing basis. However, it is evident that Storslysia will face market risks and other potential risks as below:
I.	Market rate risk: Inflation may exceed the economic growth causing a rise in the relative cost of disasters. Nonetheless, the huge amount of reserve is extremely vulnerable to market rate fluctuation. 
II.	Extreme events risk: Black swan events may occur and drain or exceed the current reserve causing the collapse of the insurance program or severe damage to the economy. 
III.	Underwriting risk: Keeping required underwriting data up to date is challenging.
IV.	Environment change risk: According to [reference 5], coastal regions had twice the growth rate compared to inland cities.  Whilst coastal regions face significantly higher risk exposure to coastal floods and the sea level is expected to continue raising in the coming decades causing more areas to be exposed to coastal related risks.
V.	Social attitude change risk: Satisfactory ruin probability was achieved by a large amount of initial reserve that taxpayers may feel reluctant to cover. 
VI.	Liquidity: Inflation and the loss in the real value of the program’s reserve urges the government to have the fund invested which may cause liquidity issues when disasters occur before the maturity date. 
VII.	Operational risk: Research into flood maps in the USA from the FEMA program has shown that flood maps drawn as recently as 2 decades ago are already incapable of accurately predicting the extent of flood damage. [8]

Hence, the corresponding mitigation strategies below may be considered. 
I.	The government should be high-risk averse when managing the reserve pool to target  
the neutralization of impacts of inflation and secure a non-negative return. 
II.	The program should only be implemented with the suggested level of the initial reserve to reach the desired level.
III.	Local governments of Storslysia should ensure housing and census information are up to date annually and the central government should raise financial, personnel and technological support to assist. 
IV.	Under planning, constructions should be advised to be located in relatively safe areas conditions on the rising sea level to reduce the potential future risk exposures. 
V.	Social awareness of the benefits of the program should be improved with publicization. 
VI.	The government of Storslysia may choose to keep the reserve and bear the potential loss caused by inflation to eliminate liquidity risk. 
VII.	Prompt updates on flood map with enhanced technology and potential collaboration with professional consultant firms in relative field will be of assistance. 

## 6. Further recommendation

In addition to the corresponding mitigation strategies for the risks mentioned above, we would like to furnish the following recommendations.

According to the risk heat map (figure 1.1), hurricanes, storms, tornadoes, winter weather and drought are high-risk hazards in Storslysia as well. Yet, without further geographical data provided, the feasibility of reducing risk exposure with the relocation cannot be assessed. Accordingly, the government of Storslysia may consider the following development advice:
•	Flood-resilient and storm-resilient buildings should be encouraged in risky regions[Appendix F]. Import tax on relevant material may be reduced. Companies that are capable of building and civilians ordering such houses should receive benefits. 
•	Temporary or permanent flood embarkment should be constructed upon the relocation progress in certain regions. 
•	Infrastructure development for improved water supply and gas supply should be reviewed. , Our team would like to offer a detailed scheme with additional data on winter weather and drought damages. 
•	Warnings on wind or storm hazards should be easily accessible to citizens. The government may refer to the Japanese earthquake notification system [Appendix G] for advisory. 

Nonetheless, the government should take moral and attitudinal hazards into consideration. The full coverage of social insurance is likely to reduce citizens’ initiatives of investing in private hazard protections and increase the likelihood of having misreported poverty damages. The government of Storslysia should enhance the supervision and offer premium reductions for households that actively improve their own private hazard protections.

Most importantly, our simulation established that our constructed program has a high-level of certainty to reduce the economic damages caused by natural hazards. However, monitoring the yearly disasters and level of reserve is essential to this program. As a consequence of severe disasters happening in the early years after the implementation and the burnout of existing reserves, adjustment on future premiums and voluntary relocation progression will be necessary. Nevertheless, periodical monitoring of Value at Risk (VaR) and the ruin probability of the program computed with simulation should be conducted.

## Conclusion 
The social insurance program and voluntary relocation scheme are expected to be financially beneficial to the Storslysia government based on our analysis introduced above. Our pricing system offers a range of scenarios based on a variety of assumptions that cover the potential outcomes of our scheme after implementation that proved the feasibility of this program. 
Yet, further monitoring and tailoring are indispensable. And a review of the enclosed limitations of our program and recommendations followed up with additional information from the government of Storslysia would be instrumental to the improved effectiveness of this program.
